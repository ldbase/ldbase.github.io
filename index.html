      <p>Welcome to LDbase, a NIH-funded collaboration between researchers and librarians to build a first-of-its-kind data repository containing decades of knowledge about learning disabilities. LDbase will be an open science resource for the educational and developmental science scientific communities, providing a secure place to store and access data and access materials about aspects of data management and analyses. The aim of LDbase is to be a powerful resource that opens up new areas of research and accelerates discoveries, inspiring innovative research that helps children with learning disabilities. More details can be found here.</p>
      <p>A working LDbase version will be available early in 2020, with initial data access available soon afterwards. By 2021, LDbase will be open to external users to submit their own data. By 2024, a fully open dataset of at least 20,000 children tested longitudinally will be released.</p> 
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Questions about LDbase can be emailed or tweeted to Drs. Sara Hart (hart@psy.fsu.edu, @saraannhart) or Christopher Schatschneider (schatschneider@psy.fsu.edu, @schotz), at Florida State University.</p>
